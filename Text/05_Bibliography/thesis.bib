This paper proposes the use of an orthogonal spherical expansion to convert the cone-surface integrals into plane integrals. The conversion technique is efficient. Once the plane integrals are obtained, a 3D image can be reconstructed by the 3D Radon inversion formula. The algorithm is implemented and computer simulations are used to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed reconstruction algorithm.},

  abstract={Photodetectors with excellent time resolution are becoming increasingly important in many applications in medicine, high energy- and nuclear physics applications, biology, and material science. Silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) are a novel class of solid-state photodetectors with good timing properties. While the time resolution of analog SiPMs has been analyzed by many groups, the time resolution of the digital photon counter (DPC) developed by Philips has not yet been fully characterised. Here, the timing capabilities of the DPC are studied using a femtosecond laser. The time resolution is determined for complete dies, single pixels, and individual single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). The measurements cover a broad dynamic range, from intense illumination down to the single-photon level, and were performed at various temperatures between 0°C and 20°C. The measured single photon time resolution (SPTR) ranges from 101 ps FWHM for the DPC3200 sensor pixel to 247 ps FWHM for the DPC6400 sensor die. An extensive study of the single-SPAD time resolution, ranging from single photon to very high laser intensities (~1000 photons per pulse), yielded a time resolution of 48 ps FWHM at the single-photon level.},

  abstract={Currently BGO (Bi 4 Ge 3 O 12 ) is widely used for the detection of high-energy particles in space applications because of its high stopping power, the non-hygroscopic characteristics and its ruggedness with respect to mechanical stress. The new Cerium doped LSO (Lu 2 SiO 5 ) offers the same benefits with higher light output capabilities and a significantly shorter decay time. We investigated key characteristics of an LSO scintillator in view of its use in space missions. We characterized the intrinsic spectrum which originates from the decay of 176 Lu and showed that it consists of three different parts arising from different effects: the native intrinsic spectrum, chance coincidence effects and energy deposition in the readout photodiode. Furthermore we investigated the light-quenching of LSO for heavy ions with measurements performed at the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC), Japan. We found that LSO is a promising candidate for future space missions.},

  abstract={Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is at present one of the major techniques for non-invasive diagnostics in nuclear medicine. The clinical routine is mostly based on collimated cameras, originally proposed by Hal Anger. Due to the presence of mechanical collimation, detection efficiency and energy acceptance are limited and fixed by the system’s geometrical features. In order to overcome these limitations, the application of Compton cameras for SPECT has been investigated for several years. In this study we compare a commercial SPECT-Anger device, the General Electric HealthCare Infinia system with a High Energy General Purpose (HEGP) collimator, and the Compton camera prototype under development by the French collaboration CLaRyS, through Monte Carlo simulations (GATE—GEANT4 Application for Tomographic Emission—version 7.1 and GEANT4 version 9.6, respectively). Given the possible introduction of new radio-emitters at higher energies intrinsically allowed by the Compton camera detection principle, the two detectors are exposed to point-like sources at increasing primary gamma energies, from actual isotopes already suggested for nuclear medicine applications. The Compton camera prototype is first characterized for SPECT application by studying the main parameters affecting its imaging performance: detector energy resolution and random coincidence rate. The two detector performances are then compared in terms of radial event distribution, detection efficiency and final image, obtained by gamma transmission analysis for the Anger system, and with an iterative List Mode-Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (LM-MLEM) algorithm for the Compton reconstruction. The results show for the Compton camera a detection efficiency increased by a factor larger than an order of magnitude with respect to the Anger camera, associated with an enhanced spatial resolution for energies beyond 500 keV. We discuss the advantages of Compton camera application for SPECT if compared to present commercial Anger systems, with particular focus on dose delivered to the patient, examination time, and spatial uncertainties.},

	Abstract = {The French national collaboration CLaRyS aims at the on-line monitoring of hadron therapy by means of imaging nuclear reaction products that are related to the ion range. For this purpose, the MoniDiam project is dedicated to the development of a large area detector with a high detection efficiency for the primary carbon or proton beams, giving time and position measurements at count rates greater than 100 MHz. High radiation hardness and intrinsic electronic properties make diamonds reliable and very fast detectors with a good signal to noise ratio. Commercial Chemical Vapor Deposited (CVD) diamonds are studied starting with plasma etch thinning and contact metallization done at the LPSC laboratory. Their applicability as particle detector is being investigated using a and \&{\#}x03B2; radioactive sources, 95 MeV/u carbon ion beams and short-bunched 8.5 keV photons from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). This last facility offers unique capability of highly focused beams, the X-ray energy deposition is continuous along the irradiated detector volume. It permits us to mimic the interaction of single ion beams. The possible application of diamonds as a position sensitive detector will be discussed from these radiation tests results. Finally, we focused on the diamond time response and energy resolution measurements. The reported study prefigures dedicated microelectronics developments.},

  abstract={In radionuclide treatment, tumor cells are primarily destroyed by charged particles emitted by the compound while associated higher energy photons are used to image the tumor in order to determine radiation dose and monitor shrinkage. However, the higher energy photons are difficult to image with conventional collimated Anger cameras, since a tradeoff exists between resolution and sensitivity, and the collimator septal penetration and scattering is increased due to the high energy photons. This research compares imaging performance of the conventional Anger camera to a Compton imaging system that can have improved spatial resolution and sensitivity for high energy photons because this tradeoff is decoupled, and the effect of Doppler broadening at higher gamma energies is decreased. System performance is analyzed by the modified uniform Cramer–Rao bound (M-UCRB) algorithms based on the developed system modeling. The bound shows that the effect of Doppler broadening is the limiting factor for Compton camera performance for imaging 364.4 keV photons emitted from 131 I. According to the bound, the Compton camera outperforms the collimated system for an equal number of detected events when the desired spatial resolution for a 26 cm diameter uniform disk object is better than 12 mm FWHM. For a 3D cylindrical phantom, the lower bound on variance for the collimated camera is greater than for the Compton imaginer over the resolution range from 0.5 to 2 cm FWHM. Furthermore, the detection sensitivity of the proposed Compton imaging system is about 15–20 times higher than that of the collimated Anger camera.},

@article{Hirasawa2003,
	Abstract = {Compton cameras have been developed for use in gamma-ray astronomy and nuclear medicine. Their defining merit is that they do not need collimators; however, on the demerit side, they need inversion procedures for image reconstruction, since a measured datum is proportional to the integration of incident gamma rays along a cone surface with the same Compton scattering angle. First, an iteration method was adopted for this task. Later, analytical methods were found under restricted conditions. Parra (2000 IEEE Trans. Nucl. Sci. 47 1543-50) deduced a purely analytical reconstruction algorithm for a complete set of scattering-projection data that include data at all the scattering angles. Tomitani and Hirasawa (2002 Phys. Med. Biol. 47 2129-45) found that by making a slight modification, Parra's algorithm could be extended to the scattering-projection data in limited scattering angles. However, their algorithm neglected the effects of practical problems that cause the degradation of spatial resolution. Sources of degradation were identified as noise in the energy signal of their front detector and the Doppler effect in the scattering process. In this paper, we first analyse the effects of these sources on the angular resolution of the scattering-projection data and then present a revised reconstruction algorithm in which these two factors are incorporated. Simulation studies on digital phantoms reveal that the algorithm can reconstruct images even when these two factors are included.},

  abstract={A major weakness of ion beam therapy is the lack of tools for verifying the particle range in clinical routine. The application of the Compton camera concept for the imaging of prompt gamma rays, a by-product of the irradiation correlated to the dose distribution, is a promising approach for range assessment and even three-dimensional in vivo dosimetry. Multiple position sensitive gamma ray detectors arranged in scatter and absorber planes, together with an imaging algorithm, are required to reconstruct the prompt gamma emission density map. Conventional block detectors deployed in Positron Emission Tomography (PET), which are based on Lu 2 SiO 5 :Ce (LSO) and Bi 4 Ge 3 O 12 (BGO) scintillators, are suitable candidates for the absorber of a Compton camera due to their high density and absorption efficiency with respect to the prompt gamma energy range (several MeV). We compare experimentally LSO and BGO block detectors in clinical-like radiation fields in terms of energy, spatial and time resolution. The high energy range compensates for the low light yield of the BGO material and boosts significantly its performance compared to the PET scenario. Notwithstanding the overall superiority of LSO, BGO catches up in the field of prompt gamma imaging and can be considered as a competitive alternative to LSO for the absorber plane due to its lower price and the lack of intrinsic radioactivity.},

  abstract={The detection of gamma rays using a camera based on Compton scattering has become widespread because of its sensitivity and efficiency. Apart from the challenge arising from the Compton camera design, another price must be paid: the complex image reconstruction process of the object under study from the measured Compton scattered data. In this paper, a mathematical model of projections generated by photons scattered in a generic Compton camera is defined, relating the projections to the object by an integral transform, namely the Compton transform. The set of projections can be split into subsets following the slope α of the direction of the scattered photons. We show that each subset allows us to invert the Compton transform and exactly recover the image of the object. In practical applications, where the number of acquired photons is low and each reconstructed image is noisy, averaging improves dramatically the signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, the validity of the approach is proved by numerical experiments.},

  abstract={The proposed research focuses on the design criteria for a Compton Camera with high spatial resolution and sensitivity, operating at high gamma energies and its possible application for molecular imaging. This application is mainly on the detection and visualization of the pharmacokinetics of tumor targeting substances specific for particular cancer sites. Expected high resolution (< 0.5 mm) permits monitoring the pharmacokinetics of labeled gene constructs in vivo in small animals with a human tumor xenograft which is one of the first steps in evaluating the potential utility of a candidate gene. The additional benefit of high sensitivity detection will be improved cancer treatment strategies in patients based on the use of specific molecules binding to cancer sites for early detection of tumors and identifying metastasis, monitoring drug delivery and radionuclide therapy for optimum cell killing at the tumor site. This new technology can provide high resolution, high sensitivity imaging of a wide range of gamma energies and will significantly extend the range of radiotracers that can be investigated and used clinically. The small and compact construction of the proposed camera system allows flexible application which will be particularly useful for monitoring residual tumor around the resection site during surgery. It is also envisaged as able to test the performance of new drug/gene-based therapies in vitro and in vivo for tumor targeting efficacy using automatic large scale screening methods.},

@article{Ortega2015,
	Abstract = {Compton Cameras emerged as an alternative for real-time dose monitoring techniques for Particle Therapy (PT), based on the detection of prompt-gammas. As a consequence of the Compton scattering process, the gamma origin point can be restricted onto the surface of a cone (Compton cone). Through image reconstruction techniques, the distribution of the gamma emitters can be estimated, using cone-surfaces backprojections of the Compton cones through the image space, along with more sophisticated statistical methods to improve the image quality. To calculate the Compton cone required for image reconstruction, either two interactions, the last being photoelectric absorption, or three scatter interactions are needed. Because of the high energy of the photons in PT the first option might not be adequate, as the photon is not absorbed in general. However, the second option is less efficient. That is the reason to resort to spectral reconstructions, where the incoming gamma energy is considered as a variable in the reconstruction inverse problem. Jointly with prompt gamma, secondary neutrons and scattered photons, not strongly correlated with the dose map, can also reach the imaging detector and produce false events. These events deteriorate the image quality. Also, high intensity beams can produce particle accumulation in the camera, which lead to an increase of random coincidences, meaning events which gather measurements from different incoming particles. The noise scenario is expected to be different if double or triple events are used, and consequently, the reconstructed images can be affected differently by spurious data. The aim of the present work is to study the effect of false events in the reconstructed image, evaluating their impact in the determination of the beam particle ranges. A simulation study that includes misidentified events (neutrons and random coincidences) in the final image of a Compton Telescope for PT monitoring is presented. The complete chain of detection, from the beam particle entering a phantom to the event classification, is simulated using FLUKA. The range determination is later estimated from the reconstructed image obtained from a two and three-event algorithm based on Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization. The neutron background and random coincidences due to a therapeutic-like time structure are analyzed for mono-energetic proton beams. The time structure of the beam is included in the simulations, which will affect the rate of particles entering the detector.},

  abstract={Hadrontherapy is an innovative radiation therapy modality for which one of the main key advantages is the target conformality allowed by the physical properties of ion species. However, in order to maximise the exploitation of its potentialities, online monitoring is required in order to assert the treatment quality, namely monitoring devices relying on the detection of secondary radiations. Herein is presented a method based on Monte Carlo simulations to optimise a multi-slit collimated camera employing time-of-flight selection of prompt-gamma rays to be used in a clinical scenario. In addition, an analytical tool is developed based on the Monte Carlo data to predict the expected precision for a given geometrical configuration. Such a method follows the clinical workflow requirements to simultaneously have a solution that is relatively accurate and fast. Two different camera designs are proposed, considering different endpoints based on the trade-off between camera detection efficiency and spatial resolution to be used in a proton therapy treatment with active dose delivery and assuming a homogeneous target.},
