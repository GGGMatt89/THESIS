misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\bf' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

! Class scrbook Error: undefined old font command `\bf'.

See the scrbook class documentation for explanation.

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\bf' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

! Class scrbook Error: undefined old font command `\bf'.

See the scrbook class documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\bf' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

! Class scrbook Error: undefined old font command `\bf'.

See the scrbook class documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.1 \chapter	{Beam tests}
                         
You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries `. Otherwise you should reconfigure

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\bf' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\bf' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\bf' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\bf' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\bf' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\bf' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\bf' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\bf', e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\bf' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\normalfont \bfseries '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
